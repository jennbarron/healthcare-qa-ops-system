# Healthcare QA Operations System  
### (AmeriHealth Program – Sanitized Case Study)

## Overview
This repository documents a real-world healthcare Quality Assurance (QA) operations system designed to onboard, standardize, and report on performance for a large QA analyst cohort. The system bridged client requirements, QA execution, and automated KPI reporting to support operational visibility and continuous improvement.

All details are intentionally sanitized. No proprietary data, internal tools, or client documents are included.

---

## Problem
A new cohort of approximately 50 QA analysts required rapid onboarding, consistent scoring standards, and reliable performance reporting aligned with client expectations. Existing processes relied heavily on manual tracking and lacked standardized calibration and KPI visibility.

---

## My Role
Owned QA operations design and execution, serving as the bridge between client stakeholders, QA teams, and reporting workflows.

Responsibilities included:
- QA onboarding framework design
- Scorecard development and calibration
- QA workflow implementation
- KPI definition and reporting automation
- Ongoing performance analysis and trend reporting

---

## Solution Architecture
The system was designed as a structured, repeatable workflow:

1. QA onboarding and expectations alignment  
2. Scorecard and evaluation criteria development  
3. Client calibration sessions to validate scoring standards  
4. QA execution within the QA platform  
5. Automated data extraction and KPI aggregation  
6. Weekly reporting and trend analysis  

---

## QA Scorecard & Calibration
- Designed a comprehensive QA question set aligned to client policy and compliance requirements
- Led calibration sessions with the client to refine scoring logic and reduce evaluator variance
- Documented scoring standards to ensure consistency across all analysts

---

## KPI Framework (Examples)
- QA accuracy rate  
- Critical error rate  
- Category-level compliance trends  
- Review volume vs analyst capacity  
- Week-over-week performance movement  

KPIs were structured to support both operational management and executive-level visibility.

---

## Reporting & Analytics
- QA data was aggregated and structured for recurring reporting
- Automated outputs supported weekly performance reviews
- Tableau-ready datasets enabled visual KPI tracking and trend analysis
- Excel was used for validation, transformation, and ad-hoc analysis
