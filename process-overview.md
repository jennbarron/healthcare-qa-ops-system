## Overview

This document outlines the end-to-end Quality Assurance (QA) and Operations workflow used to onboard, calibrate, and manage a remote healthcare QA program supporting a large payer client (sanitized case study).

The system was designed to support high-volume, distributed QA teams while ensuring consistency, compliance, and actionable performance insights for operations and client stakeholders.

## Program Scope & Constraints

- Remote QA team onboarding (~50 agents per cohort)
- Healthcare-regulated environment (HIPAA-aligned processes)
- Multiple stakeholders: client leadership, operations, QA, training
- High-volume case review with strict accuracy and documentation standards
- Need for rapid ramp-up without sacrificing quality or consistency

## QA Onboarding Workflow

1. Defined QA standards in collaboration with client stakeholders to align on expectations, scoring criteria, and escalation thresholds.
2. Built a structured QA scorecard aligned to program requirements and operational KPIs.
3. Partnered with training teams to integrate QA criteria into onboarding materials and agent readiness checks.
4. Supported new QA cohorts during live onboarding, answering clarification questions and capturing early trend signals.
5. Conducted early calibration reviews to ensure scoring consistency across QA analysts.

## Calibration & Client Alignment

- Facilitated recurring calibration sessions to review scored cases and resolve interpretation gaps.
- Documented scoring clarifications and decision rules to reduce subjectivity.
- Served as liaison between client, QA, and operations to ensure alignment and timely issue resolution.
- Updated QA documentation and guidance based on calibration outcomes.

## Issue Identification & Feedback Loops

- Monitored QA results and case review patterns to identify systemic issues.
- Flagged recurring errors tied to unclear workflows, documentation gaps, or training breakdowns.
- Partnered with operations and training to recommend targeted fixes.
- Tracked issue resolution to confirm impact on quality and efficiency.

## Outputs & Outcomes

- Consistent QA scoring across distributed teams
- Faster ramp-up of new QA cohorts
- Reduced rework caused by scoring inconsistency
- Clear documentation trail supporting compliance and audits

## Why This System Worked

The system balanced structure with flexibility, allowing QA teams to operate consistently while adapting to real-time program changes. Clear documentation, tight feedback loops, and regular calibration prevented quality drift and supported sustainable scaling.
