# QA Scorecard Framework (Sanitized)
## Healthcare QA Program

## Purpose
The QA scorecard was designed to standardize quality evaluation, reduce subjectivity, and create a shared definition of success across QA reviewers, operations, and client stakeholders.

The scorecard served as the foundation for onboarding, calibration, reporting, and performance improvement.

---

## Scorecard Design Principles

- Clear, objective scoring criteria
- Alignment to client policy and compliance requirements
- Minimal ambiguity to reduce reviewer variance
- Scalable for high-volume QA review
- Direct mapping to actionable KPIs

---

## Scorecard Structure

The scorecard was organized into logical evaluation categories to support both accuracy and diagnostic insight.

### Core Categories (Examples)

- **Policy Adherence**
  - Accuracy of decision-making
  - Compliance with documented requirements

- **Documentation Quality**
  - Completeness and clarity of records
  - Required fields and supporting evidence present

- **Process Execution**
  - Correct workflow followed
  - Timeliness and handoff accuracy

- **Communication Quality**
  - Clarity, professionalism, and appropriateness
  - Alignment with program standards

---

## Scoring Methodology

- Each category included defined pass/fail or weighted criteria
- Critical errors were clearly identified and escalated
- Non-critical errors were tracked for trend analysis
- Scoring guidance documented to support reviewer consistency

---

## Calibration Integration

The scorecard was actively used during calibration sessions to:

- Review edge cases and borderline scenarios
- Resolve interpretation differences
- Finalize scoring thresholds
- Lock definitions prior to scale

Updates were documented and communicated before production QA resumed.

---

## Operational Usage

The scorecard supported multiple operational needs:

- QA reviewer alignment
- Agent coaching and feedback
- KPI aggregation and reporting
- Identification of systemic issues
- Audit and compliance readiness

---

## Outcomes

- Reduced scoring variance across QA reviewers
- Faster onboarding of new QA cohorts
- Clear linkage between QA findings and operational action
- Increased stakeholder trust in QA results

---

## Confidentiality Note
All scorecard examples and descriptions are intentionally generalized. No proprietary criteria, thresholds, or client documentation are included.
